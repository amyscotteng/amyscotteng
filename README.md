<small>Here I am getting my 1st Dan (1st degree) black belt in tae kwon do!</small>

<h3>Hey there. I'm Amy!</h3>
<p>I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area 🌉. I also lived in sunny San Diego 🏖️ for two years where I ate a lot of Mexican food.🌯🌮 </p>

<p>When I'm not playing video games or watching history shows (both documentaries and historical dramas), you can find me working on various web development projects. I have a lot of ideas in my head and am checking them off ✔️ one by one. You can see a list of my current projects <a href="https://github.com/amyscotteng?tab=projects">here</a>.</p>

<p>I have been doing HTML and CSS for a very long time. There have been a lot of great changes over the years and I've loved them all. Out of all the changes I've seen, frameworks have been my favorite. Although I LOVE handcoding more than life itself, I am eternally grateful for frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>. The various libraries that have come out over 
the years are pretty cool too including <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">React</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue">Vue</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/angular">
Angular</a>.

</p>

<p>I currently live in Portland, OR 🌲 with my husband, Nate, who is a Senior Desktop admin 🤓. We're just a couple of nerds who love gaming 🎮 , building computers 🖥️, 
and each other 👩‍❤️‍👨 . We have a lot in common except for our musical tastes. Those couldn't be more opposite ☍. </p>

<p>I'm a big fan of:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://placekitten.com/">Placekitten</a> - How can you go wrong with adorable kittens? You can't. 🐱 </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/rosshettel/placegoat">Placegoat</a> - Because of course 🐐 </li>
    <li><a href="https://codepen.io/amyscotteng/">Codepen</a> - I'm adding new things all the time </li>
    <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> - A great resource for getting coding help aka looking up simple things I forgot how to do 🤪</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server">LiveServer</a> - Great for testing web dev projects locally! 🖥️ </li>
    <li>Sourdough bread - Of course. I grew up close to San Francisco after all! 🥖 </li>
  </ul>


</p>

<p>Feel free to look around! If you're interested in hiring me, send me an email. I'd be glad to chat with you!</p>
