<small>Here I am getting my 1st Dan (1st degree) black belt in tae kwon do!</small>

<h3>Hey there. I'm Amy!</h3>
<p>I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. I also lived in sunny San Diego for two years where I ate a lot of Mexican food.</p>

<p>When I'm not doing one of my many hobbies, you can find me working on various web development projects. I have a lot of ideas in my head and am checking them off ‚úîÔ∏è one by one. You can see a list of my current projects <a href="https://github.com/amyscotteng?tab=projects">here</a>. </p>

<p>I have been doing HTML and CSS for a long time. There have been a lot of great changes over the years and I've loved them all. Out of all the changes I've seen, frameworks have been my favorite. Although I LOVE handcoding more than life itself, I am eternally grateful for frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>. The various libraries that have come out over the years are pretty cool too including <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">React</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue">Vue.JS</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/angular">Angular</a>.

</p>

<p>I currently live in Portland, OR üå≤ with my husband, Nate, who is a Senior Desktop technician for a Fortune 100 company. I enjoy having a spouse who is in a techincal field and we have a great time building computers together. Like many, I have been binging a lot of shows on Netflix during the pandemic. So far I have finished Knightfall, The Last Kingdom, Umbrella Academy and I am working on The Crown. I'm a really big fan of historical dramas and series based on books. I watch a lot of documentaries, too. I find them fascinating. </p></p>

<p>I'm a big fan of:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://placekitten.com/">Placekitten</a> - How can you go wrong with adorable kittens? You can't.  </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/rosshettel/placegoat">Placegoat</a> - Because of course  </li>
    <li><a href="https://codepen.io/amyscotteng/">Codepen</a> - I'm adding new things all the time </li>
    <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> - A great resource for getting coding help aka looking up simple things I forgot how to do ü§™</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server">LiveServer</a> - Great for testing web dev projects locally!  </li>
    <li>Sourdough bread - I grew up close to San Francisco after all, home to the best sourdough bread in the world. </li>
  </ul>
